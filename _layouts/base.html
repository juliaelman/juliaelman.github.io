Thanks for taking a look at my source code to learn more about how I work.

Here is a list of the libraries I chose to use on this project. Most of the
time I like to experiment with different libraries on this website. It's my
personal site and use it to try out new things:

- Jekyll: A Ruby based web framework for static sites.
- Sass: a CSS preprocessor for making easier and faster to write CSS.
- Velocity: Animation library for creating the nav slide out menu animation.
- jQuery: a feature library for JavaScript that also resolves various browser
compatibility issues.

The font pairings are Raleway for headings and Open Sans for body copy. Both are Google Web Fonts and
open sourced for anyone to use:

    <div id="overlay"></div>
    <a class="skipnav" href="#content">Skip to main content</a>
