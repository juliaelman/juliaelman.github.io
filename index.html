<p>Hello! I'm Julia Elman -- a Security Experience Supervisor based in Durham, North Carolina. I lead security, user experience and engineering teams, and coach people to help them reach their full potential and create amazing things. My most recent work includes <a href="https://login.gov">Login.gov</a>, the <a href="https://developer.va.gov/">Department of Veterans Affairs API Platform</a>, <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/remote-design-visual-identity/">Zapier Visual Identity</a> and the <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/">U.S. Web Design System</a>.</p>

<p>Apart from technology, I like spending time hiking and camping in the woods of North Carolina.</p>

<p>Want to work together? <a href="mailto:hello@juliaelman.com">Iâ€™d love to hear from you</a>.</p>
