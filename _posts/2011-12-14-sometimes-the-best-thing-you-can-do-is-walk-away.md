It's late. Way too late for anyone who consistently wakes up somewhere between 5-6am regardless of what day of the week it is.

Why the heck am I up so late you ask? I've got some coding problems I am trying to solve and can't go to sleep till they are completed! Dag nabbit and harumph.

But do I really need to sit here, loosing sleep and scratching my head trying to find/Google the answer? Lately, I am finding the best thing to do when you are heading down the coding rabbit hole is to walk away. That's right. Get out of your seat, take a walk and away from your computer. I find whenever I do this, I come back to my seat feeling refreshed and get my work done faster.

So next time you are finding yourself stuck on a problem that doesn't seem to want to get solved... walk away. You'll probably find the answer when you get back.
